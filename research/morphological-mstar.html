            <h2>Predicting the stellar mass of galaxies</h2>
            <h4>based on their morphology</h4>

            <h3>The total mass of all stars in a galaxy is an important property</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>To first order, it scales with the total light that we observe, so the interesting property is <span class="highlight">mass-to-light</span></h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Traditionally, astronomers combine multiple bands into <span class="highlight">colours</span> in order to estimate the mass-to-light</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Galaxies can be roughly divided into two large classes</h3>
            <p>This is based off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence">Hubble tuning fork</a></p>
            <p>and it is definitely oversimplified...</p>

            <h4>Spiral galaxies have active star formation, and are hence <span style="color: #4287f5;">blue</span> <span class="small">(young stars are more energetic)</span></h4>
            <h4>Since young stars are very luminous, they have a <span class="highlight">low mass-to-light</span></h4>

            <h4>Elliptical galaxies are often called "<span style="color: red">red-and-dead</span>", due to their low star formation</h4>
            <h4>These objects have a <span class="highlight">high mass-to-light</span></h4>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>In this work, we predict the stellar mass-to-light based on a galaxy's <span class="highlight">morphology</span> <span class="small">(e.g. disk and spiral structure)</span>, instead of using its colour.</h4>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a> to detect the morphology features, by training on <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/">galaxy zoo</a> </h4>
            <h4>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting">gradient boosting machine</a> is used to combine all features into a final prediction.</h4>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>We find that this leads to a useful single band stellar mass prediction</h4>

            <p class="small">Predicted (g-band only) vs true mass-to-light (M/L); bottom is our method.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>However, when multiple bands are observed, the benefit of including morphology is only marginal</h4>

        <section>
            <h4>We also investigated how our predictor works, by looking at how M/L relates to the features</h4>
