  text: Already from a young age I was passionate about science and technology. This led me to persue a degree in physics and astronomy, which I completed in 2017. During my studies at Ghent University, I had a special interest in computational projects. I picked up some computer science courses and ended up doing computational astrophysics for my master's thesis. After completing my studies, I started a Ph.D. project, again in the astronomy group led by Prof. Maarten Baes. My main interests are physics, programming and machine learning, and my Ph.D. project reflects that.

    In my research I use machine learning tools to study the relation between dust and stars in galaxies. The main goal of my PhD thesis is 
    to predict far-infrared emission, on both global and resolved scales, based on the ultraviolet to near-infrared emission. <br/> <br/>

    I like programming, web development, game development, and robotics. Both during my studies as well as during my free time, I have completed various
    projects involving these topics.<br/><br/>
