        <p>In my free time, I like playing video games. Mostly on pc, sometimes on the nintendo switch. I play all kinds of games, although most of them are online and team-based.</p>

        <h3 class="changing-title">Overwatch</h3>
        <p class="changing-description">Overwatch is a first-person, hero-based shooter developed by blizzard entertainment. It is played with teams of six, where each player can pick a hero that fits the need of the team. Different heros have different roles, such as defending the team, doing damage, healing the team or distracting the enemy team.</p>

        <p class="description">This book provides a model of two modes of thinking. A fast-thinking part, that happens automatically (e.g. recognizing faces), but suffers from strong biases. And a slower, more delibarate path, that is needed to correct these biases. Understanding these biases helps the reader recognize them. The book also discusses behavioral economics, and provides a model that does not expect people to be rational.</p>
